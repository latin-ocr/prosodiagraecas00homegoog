he drawn was, either that Homer constructed his
verse without any definite rules and principles to ³
guide him, which I could not allow myself to sup·
pose, or that his language had been so altered by
ignorant grammarians and critics as to preclude
all attempts at establishing those principles upon
which he had founded it„ This latter supposition
seems to have received considerable countenance
from several eminent scholars, who, judging of
Homer’s language less from internal evidence
than their own, conceptione of what it ought to
have been from the period in which he lived, aad
the mutilated monuments of ages and people to
which no dates can be affixed,' have endeavoured
to re-establish its ancient orthography, to point .
out interpolations by succeeding Poeta, and .to '
supply those defects occasioned by-ignorance and

been as much corrupted by interpolatione and ’

thenI conceive it would be in vain to attempt

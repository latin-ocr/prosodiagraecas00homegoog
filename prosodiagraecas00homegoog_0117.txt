Ιηιὴαίιιιεά, but the latter, through sonte acciden-

= 'tal causes, cultivated the arts of life, and carried

nn commerce with different people, farther ad-
vanced in civilization and refinement, and of con-
sequence, improved their vernacular tongne, long
before the former emerged from barbarity, No·
thing differs so much as the pronunciation and or-
thography of words from one period to another,
when a language is in a progressive state of im·¹
provement The diction of Chaucer, of Gavin
Donglas, and others of the same period, is very ·
nnlilre that which was employed by 'shakespearer

and Ben Johnson: and theirs again differs from
that of Milton, Dryden, and Pope. There can
therefore be nothing drawn from the state os any
language, while yet in nsinfancy, to determine
’ certain sounds, and far less to supply imaginary

defecta in the same language, aster it hasbeen 're- ¹
fined and cultivated ¹to a high degree. This dif-
iiculty increases when the language censes to be
¹spoken, and can be resolved only by a strict ana.

' t It appears to me that the situation of Homer and shake·
npeare was, in many points, alihe. Both were gisted with err·
traordinary powers, to describe the grand the beautiful, an'd
the sublime of nature: to penetrate by instinctive sagacity hn-
mnn character, and to trace the secret, and osten the appe,
rent inconsistency of human thought and conduct: Bo'th lived
nt a period when the language of their country was greatly
improved, had acquired harnrony, and lost none ofits strength,
and still preserved, in several instaures, 'the venerable air ol
antiquity.. ·

cultivated? For language borrows its form from
the face of natureand the arts of man, multiplica

its terms as these are varied and extended, and
acquires its polish and refinement by a constant
endeavour to unite copiousness with harmony. I
think it may be asserted with truth‚ that the lo·
nian dialect, which he chiefly used, had been re·
fined as much as possible by the elision of consue
nants and the bringing together as many vowels
as were consistent with the structure of the com-
ponent parts of words and the harmony of sound.
This practice, which is common in every lan· ·
guage, was carried to a far greater extent in that
os the Greeks than in those of barbarous natione,
where amnltiplicity of consonants are· to be found
unfavourable for combination, and where the con·
stituent parts of many words cannot be discover· '

, ed in'eonsequence of the numerouselisions that
took place. How far such elisione were admitted ἣ
in the language which Homer used, may be acu-
rious and not unprofitable enquiry, but cannot in
any shape, Iimagine, affect the structure of his
verse, as they must all have been made at a pe·
riod long prior to his time*

* Mr Payne Knight, both in his Analyticnl Essay on the
Greek Alphabet and Prolegomena to Homer, has, with a great

’ deal o'f learning and ingenuity, endeavoured to ‘shew that Ho-

mer's language was not, in many instances, such as we now
have it in the editions of his worlra In this lpartly agree
with him, but upon rather different principles. His enquiries,
is my opinion be correct, go beck to a periodos the language

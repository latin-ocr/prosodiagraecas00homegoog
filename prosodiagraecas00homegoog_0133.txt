orsisii upon tha second syllable of an ‘Imaus
the second of a Spondaeus, the last osan Ana·
prestus, and, as is usually stated, upon the mid·
dle syllable of a Tribrachys and Dactyle; but, I
imagine, with more propriety equally upon the ι
two last, because the first is a resolution os an

Iambus and the other of a Spondaeus. In Troch-

first of each font, or, when the long syllable is
resolved into two short, equally upon both, that
is, they have an equal tone. So also in Herameter
verse, the irtus or orsis is always upon the first
syllable of the foot. Though we had no other
data to guidc usin the pronunciation of this spe· 1
cies of metre, it appears almost certain that the
first syllable of every foot mosthene besu pro·
nouuced with the rising inflection and consequent
swell of the voice to give melody to the verse3

and that, even though the syllable was naturally ¹
short, such an increase of time was thereby gi.

Upon what other principle can we account ‚for
the lengthening of those short caesural syllables ·

cient at present to observa, that this principle
holds, not merely in caesural syllables, such as
Clarke has frequently pointed out in several of his
notes upon the Iliad and Odyssey‚ but in four dif-
· ferent ways. 1. In coesaral syllables, ending with
along vowel, or adiphthong before another vowel
or diphthong, which in other cases is aniyhrmly
short. ΙΙ. In caesural syllables, naturally short,
which are in consequence made long. 111. Ina

short syllable at the beginning of a word, when it
happens to be the first of a foot: And, 1V..111 a

short syllable in the nziddle of a word, when it

also is made the first of a foot. The examples I
have already given, and an infinite ‚number of
others that occur in almost every page of the
Iliad and Odyssey, will be sufficient, Ι should
think, to establish the principle*

· ὓ The saure rule holds in arariety of instancea in Latin
Hexameter verse, where we find syllables naturally short, aad
unsupported by any consonante, made long by forming the first
afafoat. That they do nat occur so often in Latin as in
Greek, is owing to the greater number of consonants in tha
former. The following exaarples will serve to illustrate the ge·
aera principle: ,

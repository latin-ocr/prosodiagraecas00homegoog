may'be quoted the opinion of Dionysius of Ha)
licarnassus, in his lst book of the Roman Histos
,ryt He compares it with ‘the sound of the ου’
diphthoug in the name of the town Ovilia, com-²
monly written Velia. He also shews that the
form f, and the Latin V, were pronounced in·
the same manner: so that if his· account be cor·'
rect, neither the digamma, nor the Latin V should
have the decided sonnd of consonante, but rather
of the diphthong ou* Iu confirmation of this
opinion, we find many of the Greek writers in
1 the reign of the Caesars, and most of the Byzan-
tine historiam, employing this sound in such
·. words as Virgilius, Oupya'tpe. Valerian, Oouhtgrw.
Severus, Earingu, dre-But unless it can be shewn,

beyond the possibility of a doubt, that Homer

ὕ ‘The digamma} says Mr Knight, Analytical Essay‚p. ll,
'was certainly pronounced rather as a simple aspiretis, than as
‘an aspirated consonant, and differed from the common note¹
‘of aspiratiou, in the impulse which caused the forced expira-

‘ly the same.¹ Negat autem Priscianus, says the same author,
§ 85. Prolegom. in Ilomerum3 digamma nisi vocali, atque' ei iu
principio vocis praeponi posse, unde apud 'AEoles in β tranenses ’
quoties abt inciperet dictio, quae aspirari solita estet, ita ut
saproc, sruror, dueum. Lib. 1. p. su.

Wakefield very erroneously supposed,⁸ inserted
hythe more modern editors only of Homer’s
vorke-But let us consider what is mean‘t by the .

term hiatus. Upon this subject, I apprehend, ἱ

critics are not quite agreed. ‘Vocamus autem
‘Hiatum,’ says Hermann, in his edition of the
Orphica, ‘non eodem modo in Epicis, ut vulgo
‘in Atticis poetis solent. Apud Atticos enim
‘poetas hiatum dicunt quotiescunque vocabulum
·· ‘nwcali desinens ante vocabulum a vocali inci·
‘piens collocatur. In Epicis, pariterque in ele·
‘gotum scriptoribus et lyricis, is tantum censetur
‘hiatus si vocabuli in vocalem exeuntis ultima
‘ syllaba ante vocalem, quo sequens verbum inci·
‘ pit, non est in arsi, neque, si longa est, corripi·
‘ tur. Non ergo hi suut hiatus :'

This account of the Hiatus, or rather of the Ic· .

tus metricus, appears to me to be altogether er-

⁴* Although me s was not employed hythe modern editors
only to prevent the hiatus of vowels, as hasbeen satisfactorily
proved iu an article of the Monthly-Review‚ on Porson’s He.
cuba, vol. 28. it is, notwithstanding, doubtful whether it was
ever used by Homer for this purpose, as numerous exemplos
occur in which it is not found in any edition of his works to
, prevent the hiatus. lt is probable that the r was added by the
Alexandrian grammaticus from the practice of the Attic poets.

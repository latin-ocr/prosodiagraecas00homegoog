used the AEolic dialect ζ thal the digamma, 'ifshe
did use it, was not a vowel sound, but always
possessed the power of a consonant, and that it ,
is essentially necessary for his versification, Imust
be permitted to withhold my assent from such an
opinion. Ι have already said that the dialect
which Homer chiefly used was the Ionian and'not
the AEolian. of this we can judge only from the
character os the two as they are found in inscrip- .
. tions, on monuments, or in the waitings of the -

ancients. Every scholar knows that there are.
but few remains of the AEolic dialect now to be

'sound, and those specimens of it which still exist„
with which we ban compare 'the poenas of Homer,

bear a 'very'different appearance fro'rn his lan· ‘
guage. Iallow‚ indeed, that some peculiarities
ascribed to the AEolic dialect are to be found in
Homer 3 but the same may be said of the Attic;
for it is evident that all these dialects bore, at an
early period, a much nearer affinity to each other
than they did afterwards when spoken by diffe- , -
rent people who had made greater or less progress
-in lit terature and the arta. The decided charac- .
ter of Homer’ s language appears to me Ionian,

if I may be allowed to compare it with that of
Herodotus. There are, no doubt, distinctiva dif- -
ferenc'es between the two, but tnot more than may
be supposed to have taken place duringt the long
period that intervened from the time of the for-

mer to that of the latter, and bet tween the lan ,

guage of poetry and prosa-auus, it may be said, .

your to shew, must always be upon the first syl·
lable of every {bot 1n Hexatnet ter verse, and .
η therefore ffHermanns first example rs nothing to
the purpose in his vrew of the matter. The ictus
t’alls upon dea as the caesural syllable, which oti

long, in consequence of being the caesural syl-
lable, and therefore taking the orsis. In the
third, th'e diphthongs αι in γέφυραι and in teg-ypat-
ιαι, are both short, and have not the orsis but the ⁸
thesis, as they are not the caesural syllables. What
Ι he means by the expression ‘ neque, si longa est,
corripitur? Iconfess myself unable to understand ;
because both these diphthongs‚'equivalent to long
vowels when¹ caesural syllables are in this line ne-
cessarily short: the one forming the second, the
other the last syllable of a dactyle. It is evident,

and hiatus, ιιι his edit tion of the Orphioa‚ and the .
little information he has communicated m his
book upon thetreek metres, respecting Hexame ·
ter versat that he had very indist trnct and confus-
ed notions of its structure. We must, there

fore, enquire whether Heyne,· the last, and ιιι ἶ

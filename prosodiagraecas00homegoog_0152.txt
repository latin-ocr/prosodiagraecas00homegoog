imperfect of οὕτηαι, οὖτα for αὕτη, as κατέκτα for
κατέκτα. But l imagine the α in κατέκτα cannot
be short, as Ι know no instance of a change of
dialect of this kind, occasioning a change in the
quantity of the letter. The only instance that
can be produced of the α in κατέκτα being short,
occursio Ita 4,33.

,Καὶ ἐπεὶ ἄνδρα κατέκτα Κυθῆςααζαθέοισι. ’

In every other place where it occurs, it is always
the last word in the line, and should, 1 apprehend,
obtain that situation also in the verse above.

It is well known that Homer frequently unites
the preposition ..aaa with the following verb, if n
begin with a λ or β, as in Il. μ’, 93. καλλιτεν, for
κατέλιπεν, καλλείψω, for καταλείψω, OdySS. ν’, 208.
and in the example above, κάὶζαλεν, for κατὲἓαλεν.
Might not the praeposition have been also unit-
ed with the noun nordgau, and so have formed „
an adverbial expression? Instances os a similar
kind are not uncommon; and there are authori-
ties from ancient MSS. for the reading proposed:
Thea, at Il. ξ’, 517. where the common reading is
the same asin ζ’, 64 οὔτασε καλλατάξην is found, '
according to Heyne, “ Sch. A. et Ven. ipse,
curn ed. Rom. Utrumque agnoscit Eustath. Simi-
liter sup. 447.” lf this be obj ectedt tc, I would

propose οὔτασε παρ’ λαπάρην, as coming pretty near ,

the Homeric expression.
